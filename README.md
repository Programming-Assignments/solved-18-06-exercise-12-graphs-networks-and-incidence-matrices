<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>12.1:</strong> (8.2 #1. <em>Introduction</em> <em>to</em> <em>Linear</em> <em>Algebra:</em> Strang) Write down the four by four incidence matrix <em>A</em> for the square graph, shown below.

(Hint: the first row has -1 in column 1 and +1 in column 2.) What vectors (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>3</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>4</sub>) are in the nullspace of <em>A</em>? How do you know that (1,0,0,0) is not in the row space of <em>A</em>?

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>12.2:</strong> (8.2 #7.) Continuing with the network from problem one, suppose the conductance matrix is




0

<em>C</em> 0             <sub> </sub>.

Multiply matrices to find <em>A<sup>T</sup>CA</em>. For <strong>f</strong> = (1, 0, −1, 0), find a solution to

<em>A<sup>T</sup>CA</em><strong>x</strong> = <strong>f</strong>. Write the potentials <strong>x</strong> and currents <strong>y</strong> = −<em>CA</em><strong>x</strong> on the square graph (see above) for this current source <strong>f</strong> going into node 1 and out from node 3.
